  <h1> HELP PAGE</h1>
  <p> Of course, such a hypothetical document would fail to validate and may have accessibility problems,
     but it would render correctly in almost all browsers—the exception being old versions of Internet Explorer
      (IE). Prior to version 9, IE prevented unrecognized elements from receiving styling. These mystery elements
      were seen by the rendering engine as “unknown elements,” so you were unable to change the way they looked or
       behaved. This includes not only our imagined elements, but also any elements that had yet to be defined at
       the time those browser versions were developed. That means (you guessed it) the new HTML5 elements. </p>
